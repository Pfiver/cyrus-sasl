Description: Cyrus SASL - authentication abstraction library
 This is the Cyrus SASL API implementation.
 .
 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
 adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
 SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
 authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
 protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
 negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the
 connection. See RFC 2222 for more information.
 .
 Any of: ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI (MIT or Heimdal
 Kerberos 5), NTLM, OTP, PLAIN, or LOGIN can be used.
 .
 This package information was "forked" (read: "blantantly stolen")
 from the original maintainers and is intended mainly for personal
 use. The package must be compiled from it's source on github.
 No source nor binary packages are uploaded to the debian/ubuntu
 package repositories.
